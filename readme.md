# Space flinger
Space flinger is now an open source project. It is written in C with [gbdk-2020](https://github.com/gbdk-2020/gbdk-2020).

## Compiling
To compile the project run the `make.bat` file. To make the file work correctly, you need to move [gbdk-2020](https://github.com/gbdk-2020/gbdk-2020) to `C:\gbdk-win64` first.
The graphics files are stored in the `Assets` folder and can be opened with [gbtd](http://www.devrs.com/gb/hmgd/gbtd.html) and [gbmb](http://www.devrs.com/gb/hmgd/gbmb.html).
